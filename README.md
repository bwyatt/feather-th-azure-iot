# feather-th-azure-iot
 An internet-connected temperature and humidity monitor for 3D printer enclosures based on the [Adafruit Feather TFT ESP32-S3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5483) board and [AHT20 breakout sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4566). 
 
 Code will be written in CircuitPython, and cloud functionality will run through Microsoft Azure, with an emphasis on their low- and no-cost service tiers.

I created this project both to learn more about CircuitPython as well as Azure's IOT services. (Disclosure: I work for Microsoft, but this project is in no way sponsored or endorsed by the company.)

Feature planning & roadmaps will be maintained in this repo's Issues.
